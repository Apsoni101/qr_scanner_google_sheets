# 📱 QR Scanner Google sheets

A Flutter QR Scanner application that allows users to scan QR codes, view results, handle errors, and store scanned data in google sheets with scan data , device id , timestamp , userid .  
The app follows **Clean Architecture**, uses **BLoC** for state management, and supports **offline storage**. 

Note 1 :- when app has no internet it saves data locally and when connection restores it automatically syncs with remote google sheet in home screen also the list of google sheets is cached for offline access. 

Note 2 :- The app can only list the sheets that are created in app by user (done intentionally) .
